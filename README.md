      ~~A SIMPLE LISTVIEW~~
      
 -Perhaps you are wondering what is a listview?-
 
Simply a Listview is used to display data in a vertically scrollable manner.

Below is a simple application in which it displays different makes of Automotive Cars within the listview along with their names.

Alongside this simple listview, There is a custom listview which is more appealing with images.

The list view will be created using the RecyclerView widget, which is a more efficient and flexible way to display large lists of data compared to the older ListView widget. The RecyclerView widget will allow the application to recycle and reuse list items, improving performance and reducing memory usage.

The project will also implement a simple onItemClickListener function that allows users to select an item in the list view and perform an action. For example, clicking on an item in the list could display more details about the item or take the user to a different screen or activity.

Overall, the Simple List View in Kotlin project will be a straightforward and useful application that provides a basic user interface for viewing and interacting with a list of items. The application will demonstrate the use of the RecyclerView widget and follow best practices for Android development, making it a good starting point for learning more advanced concepts and features in Kotlin and Android app development.

Take a look at it!
